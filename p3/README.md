## Notes for instructor

- You might need to 'bash setup' inbetween Cypress tests
- I had some trouble with the adding and removing favorites tests. Within cypress the add/remove buttons or favorites page wasn't updating and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. They do function normally when I test it myself, just not in the Cypress tests.
- You must click out of a input field before being able to click on the buttons.

Thanks for teaching the class, I definitely learned a lot! :D
